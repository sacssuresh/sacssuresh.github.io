        <h1>Professional work and what I do for a living</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
            I enjoy building systems that feel simple, reliable, and thoughtful.
            Most of my work revolves around understanding real-world behavior
            and designing solutions that stay practical and predictable.

    <h3>Observability vs Monitoring</h3>

    <p>
        Monitoring tells you <em>what</em> is happening.  
        Observability helps you understand <em>why</em> it’s happening.
    </p>

    <p>
        Monitoring is tool-driven — dashboards, alerts, metrics.  
        Observability is behaviour-driven — signals, traces, and context that reveal how a system behaves under real-world conditions.
    </p>

    <h4>How do you set up effective monitoring?</h4>

    <p>
        In my experience, the foundation of monitoring must be driven by a senior architect or a distinguished engineer — not delegated downward. 
        Proper monitoring is a first-class architecture concern.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Step 1 — Define SLAs, SLOs, and Error Budgets</strong><br>
       Sit down and write your service-level objectives clearly.  
       Define acceptable latency, slowness, and failure windows.  
       These numbers drive everything else.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Example:</em>  
        A user-facing authentication service needs tighter alert boundaries than a notification service.  
        A missed login breaks the user journey; a delayed notification does not.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Step 2 — Socialize shared language</strong><br>
       Teams should deeply understand terms like <em>error budget</em>, <em>acceptable downtime</em>, and <em>recovery time</em>.  
       Without common language, monitoring becomes inconsistent across services.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Step 3 — Prefer percentages, not raw counts</strong><br>
       “Error rate > 5%” is correct.  
       “Error count > 10” is not.  
       Percentages scale with traffic; raw counts don’t.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Step 4 — Avoid unnecessary alerts</strong><br>
       Alert fatigue is very real.  
       I’ve seen on-call engineers and escalation leads get woken up at midnight for alerts that were simply misconfigured.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Example:</em>  
        Firing an alert for “error increase in last 15 minutes” is misleading.  
        What you want is a <strong>sustained</strong> error rate increase, not small pockets of failure due to natural downstream variance, throttling, or partner system hiccups.
    </p>

    <h4>Modern Tooling</h4>

    <p>
        Modern observability platforms offer anomaly detection, pattern-based alerting, and AI-assisted insights.  
        But the real value still comes from choosing an architecture that fits your system’s nature, scale, and cost boundaries.
    </p>

    <h4>What I Prefer</h4>

    <p>
        I like OpenTelemetry for tracing, Prometheus for metrics, and Elastic for logs.  
        It’s a modern, clean, vendor-neutral setup — but cost remains the invisible architecture decision-maker.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over the years, I’ve also used AppDynamics, Datadog, and Splunk. All are excellent tools if cost is not your top concern.
