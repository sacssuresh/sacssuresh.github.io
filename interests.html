  <h3>🚶‍♂️ Walking & Long-Distance Exploring</h3>

  <p>
    Walking is an underrated form of exercise. Its real power comes from consistency, not intensity.
    Even 4–5K steps a day compounds quietly — 40K in 10 days, 80K in 20, and before you realize it,
    you’ve crossed 100K steps without burnout.

  <p>
    Consistent walking helped me significantly improve my health — including reversing early fatty-liver indicators without extreme workouts or rigid routines. I didn’t focus on weight loss; the benefits showed up internally first.
  </p>

  <p>
    It also corrected subtle posture issues from long hours of sitting — my forward-bent neck gradually straightened
    as walking became a daily habit.
  </p>

  <p>
    More than anything, walking boosts my productivity. After a walk, my thinking is clearer, focus improves,
    and problem-solving feels easier.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve walked most routes across North Dartmouth and plan to build a small app that visualizes my walking heatmap
    over time — a personal experiment combining movement, data, and mapping.

  <h3>📚 Reading & Curiosity</h3>

  <p>
    Reading has always been a deep source of curiosity for me especially books on history, philosophy,
    culture, and human behavior. I enjoy understanding how ideas evolve and why people think the way they do.

  <p>
    At one point, reading — especially Tamil literature became almost addictive. The richness of the language
    and the depth of writing pulled me into long reading marathons, day and night, driven by the urge to finish
    books as quickly as possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    I eventually had to step back and create boundaries. Learning when to pause became just as important as
    learning itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, I’ve built a curated collection of Tamil and tech books that I believe everyone should read
    a blend of language, thought, and engineering.
